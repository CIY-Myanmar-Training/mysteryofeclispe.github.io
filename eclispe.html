    <h1 class="heading">What Is An Eclispe?</h1>
    <p>An eclipse is when one celestial body moves into the shadow of another.</p>
    <p>There are two main types of eclispe:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Solar Eclispe</li>
        <li>Lunar Eclispe</li>
    </ol>

    <p><em><strong>Imagine playing hide and seed with sun, earth and moon.</strong></em></p>


    <h1 class="heading">Solar System</h1>
    <p>The Solar System is the Sun and all the objects that orbit around it. The Sun is orbited by planets, asteroids,
        comets and other things.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Solar Eclispe
            <p> When the Moon comes between the Sun and Earth, casting its shadow on Earth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Lunar Eclispe
            <p>When the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, causing the Earth's shadow to fall on the Moon.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="heading"> Why Do Eclipse Happen?</h1>
    <img src="orbit.jpg" width="300" height="90"></img>
    <p>Eclipses happen when the Sun, Moon, and Earth orbit. Sometimes,
        the Moon moves between the Sun and the Earth, blocking the Sun's light,<br> and that's called
        a Solar Eclipse. Other times, the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, casting
        a shadow on the Moon, and that's a Lunar Eclipse. It's like the Sun,<br> Moon, and Earth are
        taking turns hiding behind each other in the sky</p>
